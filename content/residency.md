The only cost for participation is for food and accommodation at La Cheraille during the week. This will be approximately **€85 a day for a shared apartment and €55 for a shared dormitory** (depending on availability).

All food will be organic and much of it will come direct from La Cheraille’s gardens and is included in the accommodation cost. We will get to pick our own vegetables from the soil and cook it together.
