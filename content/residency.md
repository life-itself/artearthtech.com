The Art Earth Tech residency provides affordable access to inspiring locations where you can focus on your ideas and projects whilst supported and connected to our community.

The residencies are located in our homes in London, England; La Cheraille (a farm near Paris) and soon Bergerac, both in France. These can be for a minimum of a week and a maximum of three months.
 
The residencies are open to people of all backgrounds, professions and ages. Our residencies are not sponsored or subsidised, but are paid for by the guest and the generosity of the Art / Earth / Tech community.
