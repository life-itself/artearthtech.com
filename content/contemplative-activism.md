# Context 

Many people come to a realisation that our enivronmental crisis is part of a much deeper crisis, which has to do with our alienation from the source of our deepest intelligence and wisdom. This includes many famous writers and spiritual leaders like Joanna Macy, Martin Heidegger, and Thich Nhat Hanh, but also many normal people who just can't shake the impression that something really big is missing from life. 

Our deepest contemplative (or spiritual, or mystical) intelligence and our disconnection from it are something that we experience in a deeply subjective way. We know something is missing from life when we are outside of it, even though it seems like our society encourages this. We cannot point directly to this intelligence or to its absence, so when one of us comes strongly into contact with this intelligence, they tend to think they have seen something very new and unlike what other people are talking about. So we have invented many words and phrases like being _"embodied", "present". "aware", "mindful", "connected", we experience "suchness", "thusness", "tatata" and "non-duality."_ These are all pretty much the same thing. More words for the same thing won't make more people understand these words mean. They must see it directly themselves to know what the words refer to, and this is the hardest thing to accept. We can't tell people "just do it" and expect results.

## So what do we do? 

The good news is that many, many people have been responding to this lack. It is afterall, the lack of perhaps the most important thing in life. Practices such as mindfulness and other meditation, shamanism, reconnection, many strands of visual and performance, body work, plant medicines, many forms of trauma therapy, intellectual movements such as phenomenology, work on embodiment, and on hemispheric differences in the brain all may be seen as responses and gestures towards ways of widening awareness of our situation. 

But these movements are still just beginning to become more than the sum of their parts. They are not aware of themselves as working for the same thing. **Part of what we are hoping to do is collectively raise awareness of our pursuits' intertwinedness, but also to co-create a space for these related pursuits to make each other more whole and more effective**. Also though, there is the question of resisting confinement of these concerns to the private "non-political" sphere, resisting the idea that these conversations belong in a "non-secular" ghetto while in the public sphere, we continue to pretend that the only things that are real and important are those that we can see and touch. Politics shapes the public consciousness, like it or not. Apolitical wholeness is an oxymoron.

**Contemplative activism also means embracing the need for planning and organisation, while not being a slave to accomplishments and goals.** Teaching meditation or doing art requires some planning. Using concepts is not a sin, nor is technical knowledge. It is just that the analytical mind is a spectacular servant and a bad master. We will never be effective in restoring balance by denying either the analytical or the rational mind.
