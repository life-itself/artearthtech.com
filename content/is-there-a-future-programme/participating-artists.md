### Gratitude

**Durational performance** ( 7:20pm)

_performed by_ _Sylvie Shiwei Barbier_

&#39;We can not transform what we make wrong&#39; only by bringing love, acceptance and gratitude can we start changing our present and define our future differently.

The performance is to reconnect the audience powerfully to their collective ancestral past.

The act of expressing gratitude connects us with everything that came before us and allows us to be powerfully present to the different possibilities of our future. Grace allows us to be present to our interdependence with the Earth and others, that we are a part of a network of actions and consciousness. In the process of bringing a human being already in existence yet not born, the performance aims to connect both mother and child to the greater context of which they are part. Because all of us have been one with another at some point. Their unity is structural, physical and acts as a reminder of our collective unity and coexistence. Our current challenges require us to be committed to something bigger than ourselves, because only by doing so can we go beyond what separates us, accept our differences, work with them and create a harmonious future. But first, one wants to water the seeds of love and wisdom. Expressing gratitude has always been a spiritual practice across traditions, so there must be a collective wisdom in this action.

**Sylvie Shiwei Barbier** is a French - Taiwanese artist who works primarily with the body as a medium in the form of performance art, photography and videos.

### Umbilical

**One to one duration performance** (7:20pm)

_performed by Niya B_

Umbilical stories, navel sensualities and reproductive desires. Niya B examines the post-reproductive body and a deep sense of longing to nurture life. Revitalising her umbilical cord and the sensuality of her navel, she wishes to reconnect with the m-other.

Following her work Collective Lover, where Niya explored intimacy with plants, desire for the more-than-human and the possibility for an eco-gender subjectivity, in Umbilical she explores her reproductive instincts and mothering desires within the context of climate change, human overpopulation and the requirement of sterilization for transgender people (only abolished by the European Court of Human Rights in 2017 but that is still in place in many countries all over the world).

Niya is a transfeminine artist interested in social change and shifting paradigms. Experimenting with original creative processes and media, she explores the body and its context, as a form of expression and manifestation of culture, ideology, gender, sexuality, social ethics, systemic issues and collective aspirations.

### Notes on Kinship 

**Spoken word performance** (7:45)

_performed by Verity Birt_

Verity Birt&#39;s practice and PhD research speculates on prehistoric (pre-capitalist/pre-patriarchal) models to help us imagine more inclusive and sustainable futures. Notes on Kinship aims to disrupt heteronormative nuclear family models by thinking through ideas of communal, extended and shared child care. Having recently donated her eggs to a friend to start a family, Verity shares her thoughts and speculations on alternative sustainable models of shared kinship and asks what this could mean for the future.

**Verity Birt** is an artist and researcher based in London. Through processes of excavation (online and on-land) of archaeology, technology and mythology, she aims to mobilise narratives from epistemologies which have been historically suppressed and eradicated. Imagination, storytelling and mythmaking are invoked through sculpture, performance, text, sound and moving-image; creating thresholds into multiple durations and materialities. She has been involved with collaborative research groups; The Future is a Collective Project, Reconfiguring Ruins, The Overview and a founding member of female artist collective Altai.

### The Mother - the afterbirt

_Mixed media object, wax, fabric, crystals, honey, onions, wood, rope_

_to mother, a birth, a collective act, an act of reproductive and non-reproductive production, an action of care_

What you see here was unknown at the beginning. The Mother object came into being through a collective ceremony that took place between women from Xenia, a group of migrant and English-speaking women that we worked with in 2017. Through an improvised ritual of materials and sound, the Mother was formed. After several hours of process, shared labours, chants and whispers we gathered around her, moved, in hands and some in tears. One woman spoke that the process of making the mother was like a funeral and a birth, it was necessary to bury our conceptions of motherhood - to birth new life into the idea of the divine, limitless, transformative power of the archetypal mother.

### The Mother - the afterbirth

_Performance for medium format photography_

A series of processes in the landscape with the mother object for medium format film. Carrying and imbuing the object with the messages of nature. These journeys have honoured the archetypal experience of the great mother that lives within us all, across time and cultural distinction, bringing us closer to the cycle of the divine mother.

### The Mother - the afterbirth

_Video and sound piece_

_To birth a creative work, is to birth a collective substance, a materialisation of an inner world, it is the alchemy of the invisible substance transformed by the hand into visible substance._

_Laboured over and cared for, through traces of material, dust, bowls of wax, fire, ash, clay, held by a community, sung to, moved around. Immersed in a village scale. To birth a creative work is inherently a social practice and what is left in material form is all but a fragment of the processes that came before._

The video shows the making of what became the Mother object through a collective ceremony that took place between women from Xenia, a group of migrant and English-speaking women that we worked with in 2017. The gathering began around a black piece of felt, we had a fire that melted wax and fragments of materials that the women had symbolic connection with. The women slowly began creating a constellation and a moving mantra of stones, butter, garlic, shells and rope, whilst chanting in their indiginous languages, words of deep remembrance. Through this improvised ritual, the Mother was formed. After several hours of process and shared labours we gathered around her, moved,  in hands and some in tears. One woman spoke that the process was like a funeral and a birth, it was necessary to bury our conceptions of motherhood in order to birth new life into the idea of the divine, limitless, transformative power of the archetypal mother.

**Fourthland** have a longstanding commitment to socially engaged and collaborative practice and often work with communities to harvest existing knowledge from a variety of cultures. These collaborations take the form of making objects and gatherings in order to create new myths about land and people that transcend dominant modes of separation and disillusionment. These new myths lead in turn to the production of an ecosystem of objects, performances, sounds, ceremonies and re-enactments. Exploring enchantment and the sacred through human and non-human realms, the archetype and embodied wisdom.

### Brain Child

Brain Childis a conversation piece involving two people who share a life as well as a love of words, and who have decided, together, to sign the Birth Strike declaration. Although wanting a child, they feel unable to become parents in the face of climate and ecological break down. Listening to an intimate conversation, which explores the creators&#39; personal and ongoing process of decision-making, visitors are brought to inhabit a space ridden with uncertainty, loss and grief, as well as trust and ambivalence. It&#39;s a conversation and a dilemma which an increasing number of would-be parents face.

They have joined the **Birth Strike Movement** - the clarion call of would-be parents who feel unable to have children in the face of ecological and climate collapse. With over 400 women and men having signed the declaration, they demand system change and immediate government action.

**Jessica Gait√°n Johannesson** is a writer and activist. Her work has appeared in The Scotsman, The Stinging Fly and Litro magazine among other publications. She lives in Bath.

**Adam Ley-Lange** is a short story writer and activist. He has an MA in Creative Writing from Bath Spa University and is an editor for the literary magazine Structo. Jessica and Adam signed the Birth Strike declaration as a family in March 2019.

### Surrender

Surrender is an exploration of our desire to control our lives and futures. This work was created whilst processing the experience of a future that disappeared through miscarriage.

Exploring loss of control and a deep reconnnection to the cycles of mother earth in the journey to creating new life, the artist seeks to surrender to the ultimate power of nature to dictate our futures. With increasing studies showing the impact of environmental factors on public health and fertility, the cycle of the stones reflects the limitations we are reaching in our exploitation of mother earth.

**C√©cile Embleton** is an artist, filmmaker and documentarian. Her films have shown in film festivals across the world and she has been supported by the British Council Film to present her work in the United States and Europe.

### From You to Me

_&quot;Every mother contains her daughter in herself and every daughter her mother, and every woman extends backwards into her mother and forwards into her daughter. This participation and intermingling gives rise to that peculiar confusion as regards to time: woman lives earlier as a mother and later as a daughter.&quot; C G Jung_

The short film explores the close bonds between the four generations of women within the artist&#39;s own family, while at times also touching on the more hidden issues and darker concerns of the family history, in particular the questions of psychogenealogy (the effects of transgenerational transmission in a person&#39;s life.)

TS: By examining my place within my own female line, I am trying to make sense of my own place in the world, not only as an individual, but also as part of an ongoing generational narrative. Reproduction here becomes an affirmation of life, the line of daughters the manifestation of a genuine faith in the future, as well as gratitude to those who came before. Additionally, the process of filming and editing becomes a form of questioning and examining the life choices one makes and the motivations behind these. Making films as a way of striving to become more conscious, which, I believe is necessary in order to live a more responsible life.

**Tereza Stehl√≠kov√°** is an artist and works as a senior lecturer in still and moving image theory and practice, at the University of Westminster, as well as a visiting lecturer at the Royal College of Art. She holds a PhDfrom the RCA, where she researched the tactile language of moving image. She is currently engaged in a cross-disciplinary research, investigating how moving image can be used to communicate embodied experience.
