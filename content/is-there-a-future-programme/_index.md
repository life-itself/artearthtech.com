Should we have children or stay childfree in the midst of an ecological crisis? ‘Is there a Future?’ -
an evening of performance and installation art aiming to open a safe space for discussion looking
at our future, the ecological landscape and our evolving relationships with the idea of family within
It.

The programme sees diverse and thought-provoking responses to the question, featuring works by international artists and activists, including members of the BirthStrike movement, Jessica Gaitán Johannesson & Adam Ley-Lange presenting a personal, ongoing process of decision-making; French/Taiwanese performance artist Sylvie Shiwei Barbier exploring her pregnant body and the celebration of a new life, and a spoken-word piece by artist and researcher Verity Birt, exploring alternative sustainable models of shared kinship to create a more inclusive and sustainable future. The diverse group will delve into and trigger thoughts around themes including eco-gender subjectivity, the impact of climate change on public health and fertility, women’s lineages and the lost connection with mother earth, and ultimately, faith in the future.

Alongside the artworks, an open conversation will bring together different members of activist
groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Birth Strike - a movement of over 400 people who have
decided not to procreate in response to the coming ‘climate breakdown and civilisation collapse’ -
and researchers actively looking at alternative models for a more sustainable future.
