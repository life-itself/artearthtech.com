**Kay Michael** is a theatre-maker who in April co-launched Culture Declares Emergency, a movement that invites artists and cultural organisations to declare climate and ecological emergency and take radical action for justice. CDE currently has over 500 declarers (recent declarers include The Tate and Sir Anthony Gormley) and it continues to grow with self-organising initiatives and local groups springing up across the country. Letters To The Earth was a CDE campaign which received over 1000 letters in response to the emergency from the general public as well as notable writers such as Rebecca Solnit, Jay Griffiths and Yoko Ono. These were presented at venues across the world and on stages at the spring Rebellion. The campaign will soon go live again and an anthology of Letters will be published this autumn.
