CRI was founded by Fran√ßois Taddei and Ariel Lindner in 2005 to create a student/researcher centered open environment in which they can collaborate together to build a world where lifelong learning is at the heart of our society.

To help everyone take care of oneself, others and the planet, CRI is co-constructing and sharing new ways of learning, teaching and mobilizing collective intelligence in the fields of life, learning and digital sciences.

Sitting at the crossroads of research and education, CRI advocates for innovative pedagogy putting the student at the heart of their own learning experience through projects, research and societal challenges.
