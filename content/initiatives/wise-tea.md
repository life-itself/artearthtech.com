Wise Tea is a web-documentary questioning what it means to be Taiwanese. The project seeks to build a narrative around what constitutes Taiwanese wisdom and identity, delving into its complexity, taboos and ambiguity.

Wise Tea relates the journey of two young women, an artist and a political scientist,  wishing to enquire about their Taiwanese roots. A camera in their hand, they will go and meet Taiwanese people across the island. They start the journey with two fundamental questions about themselves, but also about Taiwan as a nation: Where do we come from?  Where are we going? They will travel, interview and film, capturing the memory of Taiwan, past and present. The numerous encounters, interviews, testimonies and daily impressions will be shared around cups of tea. The project will take the form of  a compilation of short videos on a website as well as an art exhibition taking place in Taipei around March 2018.

Wise Tea serves two goals. First, it aims to spark an open conversation within Taiwanese society about what it means to be Taiwanese - a topic which has often been divisive and controversial at home and abroad. Secondly, it aspires to build a platform through which what is precious about Taiwan can be shared with the broader international community. The purpose is to build an authentic narrative going beyond bias propaganda, or the cliches of night markets and bubble tea.
