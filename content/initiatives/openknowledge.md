Open Knowledge International is a global non-profit organisation focused on realising open dataâ€™s value to society by helping civil society groups access and use data to take action on social problems. Open Knowledge International does this in three ways:

<p> 1.) Showing the value of open data for the work of civil society organizations </p>
<p> 2.) Providing organisations with the tools and skills to effectively use open data </p>
<p> 3.) Making government information systems responsive to civil society </p>

Open Knowledge International is a worldwide network of people passionate about openness, using advocacy, technology and training to unlock information and enable people to work with it to create and share knowledge.
