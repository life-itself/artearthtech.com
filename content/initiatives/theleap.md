##### The Life Expression and Aspiration Project

</br>
<img src="/images/leap04.jpg">

In Taiwan, we work hard. But while we spend long hours at school, we often spend far too little time building the soft skills necessary to thrive in today’s society: self-confidence, self-expression, creativity, autonomy, and curiosity.

 The LEAP is a two week summer program, which nurtures your creative spirit, increases your self-confidence, enhances your self-expression and empowers you to create an exciting future.

We believe in an education that nurtures strong, independent spirits, and a pedagogy which stimulates rather than intimidates. We have built a program that teaches both socio-professional and life skills.

**The LEAP is the Life Expression and Aspiration Project** – and a new model for education in Taiwan.
