In Taiwan, they work hard. But while they spend long hours at school, they often spend much less time building the soft skills necessary to thrive in today’s society: self-confidence, self-expression, creativity, autonomy, and curiosity.

The LEAP is a two week summer program, which nurtures your creative spirit, increases your self-confidence, enhances your self-expression and empowers you to create an exciting future.

The LEAP is about education that nurtures strong, independent spirits, and a pedagogy which stimulates rather than intimidates. It has built a program that teaches both socio-professional and life skills.

**The LEAP is the Life Expression and Aspiration Project** – and a new model for education in Taiwan.
