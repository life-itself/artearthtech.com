Plum Village, near Bordeaux in southwest France, is a world renowned practice center for mindfulness, and the first monastic community founded by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh in the West. The Plum Village practice has been highly influential in the rise of the modern mindfulness movement.

Plum Village is where Thich Nhat Hanh has realised his dream of building a Beloved Community: creating a healthy, nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the Earth.
