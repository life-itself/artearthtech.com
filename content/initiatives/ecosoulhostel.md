A hostel in London where people who share values of social change, sustainability and inner wellbeing can connect and inspire each other

The hostel is run with love by volunteers. They live here for up to a year, cooking, cleaning and hosting the community.

We positively welcome people of all genders, sexual orientations and ethnic backgrounds.

We invite guests to enjoy a sense of shared responsibility for the living space. For example, we  will ask you to put your plates in the dishwasher and strip the bed when you leave.
