## More about our space

Our centrally located new hub opens in September for people who choose to live in community, and to live in a weller, wiser world. What does that mean? It means living with deep purpose, deep presence… and a sense of humour is crucial.
Well connected by public transport UBhf Gneisenaustraße on the tree lined Gnierstrausse, the area is full of cafes, restaurants, banks, bars, boutiques, two parks, two supermarkets (one vegan!), a market and lots of life.

## More about Art / Earth / Tech community

Art / Earth / Tech brings together artists, neuroscientists, activists, teachers… a collection of people from different backgrounds, viewpoints, ages and disciplines who are driven to make a considered difference in their lives, and in the world. We are committed to finding our greatness and having communities across Europe in rural and urban settings to support people and their projects.

## Why is this exciting?

Why join us? Do you ever feel like you know the problem, you know the solutions but you’re not quite walking the talk, shall we say? Living in community helps us stand for who we want to be in the world, and what we want to do in it. It also makes it easier because you can get things moving quicker, from thought to action, you can find the people you need to get your idea off the ground, or the lifestyle you choose to live in.  

The people behind Art Earth Tech have experience in living in communities across the world, both on rural farms and in dense urban centres. We are now called to start more across the world and want samurai to bring these to life.

Art Earth Tech is a group of people who have come together because they believe a weller, wiser world is possible. On one side we dedicate time and thought to exploring these ideas in our Institute http://artearthtech.com/blog/ , event series and our annual Gathering http://artearthtech.com/gathering/ outside Paris in rural France, which we would request you join us for. We practice and explore these ideas in our communities in La Cheraille, France, and in Hoxton, London. We are new and expanding our network at speed as more of us seek to contemplate, to explore and to collaborate on projects that bring forth a better future for all of us, and the Earth.

In all our hubs, we have a residency programme LINK http://artearthtech.com/residency/ where people stay on a short term basis 1-3 months to work on a project or idea they have that needs space to hatch.
This is also fun for the hub as you get to meet new people and new views. We have put a lot of thought into our Governance model, which we would be happy to share with you (it’s super interesting, we think) http://artearthtech.com/files/aet-governance.pdf
Each hub is also a beacon for our wider community, and they host large suppers, talks, film screenings, walks, whatever you would like to share.


## What we are looking for

We are looking for people who get you need to look at the inner in order to affect the outer world. We also want people who are open, active and not stuck in their thoughts and heads. We need to put this into practice, take risks, be courageous and be unreasonable sometimes. We are on an enquiry of self- awareness and that is why we value communal living to support that growth.
There is not one specific criteria we are looking for as our family is international, representative and fair. You need to be comfortable sharing your views on the bigger controversial issues as well as personal issues. You understand where your responsibility lies, including for yourself. This is key for living in community, well. You find refuge in silent moments alone or together.
