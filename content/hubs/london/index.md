The Art Earth Tech London Hub in Shoreditch is a refuge from the dreary busyness of city life but retains all the excitement, energy and drive of London’s fast lane. It’s a place to connect and laugh, to learn and share. A space to discuss the trends shaping our society and the ideas that will determine our future; where networks are created to support one another in the projects that evolving our economy and society towards a wiser, greener and weller world.

We are practical and natural. We connect the ancient and the modern. Our interests ranges from nature to neuroscience, Dada to data. We seek harmony and to disrupt, bringing together art and technology, earth and spirit, science and wisdom, freedom and discipline, mindfulness and intention. Our name reflects this commitment to a holistic approach.

The hub is a home for Londoners looking to find a middle-way between the hamster wheel and [Mani wheel][wheel], the condo and the campervan. Through dinners, film screenings, poetry nights, talks and sprint weekends we come together to be and to do, but mostly be. The doing always takes care of itself when the being is good.
