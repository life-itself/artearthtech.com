## Reconnecting with ourselves, others, and the wider world

  
Through this manifesto we wish to promote a form of coliving which has _connection_ at its heart.

We believe conscious coliving can have a transformative impact on our society by tackling loneliness, providing spaces to connect with our authentic selves, and encouraging us to live in a way which is more aligned with our planet’s natural systems. 

 We define co-living as “a modern form of housing where residents share living space and a set of values and/or intentions.  It’s a new take on an old idea, imagined by a millennial generation that values things like openness and collaboration, social networking, and the sharing economy.”

Adding the "conscious" to co-living means living in a community where awareness of ourselves, other people and the world around us is encouraged, so that residents can help each other to live more meaningful, environmentally sustainable and emotionally fulfilling lives. Living consciously within a community allows us to live by our values, and in doing so enables us to bring about positive change, whether within ourselves, our co-living community, the wider community or the environment.  

Conscious coliving challenges the status quo of materialism, ownership, and individualism and offers a new way of living which is geared towards sharing, community and sustainability.
