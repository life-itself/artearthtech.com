<p> Through this manifesto we wish to promote a form of co-living which has connection at its heart. </p>

<p> We believe conscious co-living can have a transformative impact on our society by tackling loneliness, providing spaces to connect with our authentic selves, and encouraging us to live in a way which is more aligned with our planet’s natural systems. </p>

<p> We define conscious co-living as a modern form of housing where residents share space, living in a community where shared values allow a greater awareness of themselves, other people and the world around them, so that residents can help each other to live more meaningful, environmentally sustainable and emotionally fulfilling lives. </p>

<p> Conscious co-living challenges the status quo of materialism, ownership, and individualism and offers a new way of living which is geared towards sharing, community and environmental sustainability. </p>
