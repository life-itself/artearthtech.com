title: " Conscious Co-living Manifesto"

---
## Reconnecting with ourselves, others, and the wider world

Through this manifesto we wish to promote a form of coliving which has _connection_ at its heart.

We define co-living as “a modern form of housing where residents share living space and a set of values and/or intentions.  It’s a new take on an old idea, imagined by a millennial generation that values things like openness and collaboration, social networking, and the sharing economy.”

Adding the "conscious" to co-living denotes a way living that encourages a deepened awareness of ourselves, other people and the world around us. Living consciously within a community, we can help one another live more meaningful, environmentally sustainable and emotionally fulfilling lives.

We believe conscious coliving can have a transformative impact on our society by tackling loneliness, providing spaces to connect with our authentic selves, and encouraging us to live in a way which is more aligned with our planet’s natural systems.

Conscious coliving challenges the status quo of materialism, ownership, and individualism and offers a new way of living which is geared towards sharing, community and sustainability.
