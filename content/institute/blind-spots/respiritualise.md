We are supposedly leaving the notion of progress behind in the postmodernism era, but it is still here with us.
Do we have too much faith in our technology because its dazzling past? Do we overrate what computers can do for us?
Is it still something of a religion to believe in science and in technology as solutions to our problems? How do we let go of this, if it blinds us?
Does it create a spirituality vacuum?

More information will soon be available.
