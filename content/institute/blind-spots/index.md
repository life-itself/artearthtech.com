Blind Spots is our new series of conversations exploring the collective blind spots of our society.

What is holding us back from creating a powerful vision for our future? What's behind the rise in populism? What's stopping us addressing climate change effectively?


## What is a blind spot?

Literally a blind spot is a part of our visual field we can't see -- and which we don't realise we can't see!

More generally, imagine you are in your car parking at the supermarket, you look around, check, then back up and CRASH! You've driven into a pole. When you get home, your partner says "Didn’t you look and check your mirrors?!" You say "Of course I did! But it was in my blind spot!"

Our blind spots are not only what we can’t see but what we can’t see that we can’t see. What we don’t know and that we don’t know that we don’t know.

In this series we are interested in our **collective** blind spots: those things that are collectively invisible to us, but which are holding us back. For example, why can’t we envision anything better than slight upgrades from capitalism 2.0 to 2.1? Why is it that the words such as "utopia", "community", "spirituality" or "big vision" are met automatically with skepticism or fear?




## Why is looking at our blind spots important?

We think that key things hidden in our collective blindspots are in the way of creating a powerful vision for the future -- and keeping us dissatisfied.

We want to create powerful vision for our future. But we can't have a conversation about the future until we have completed the past. And what is holding us back are our collective blind spots. Without discovering our blindspots, what is hidden in there holds us back (and we don't even realise it is holding us back).

It is crucial to complete our past before we can create a new future -- otherwise all we do is repeat the past. At the moment, our conversation for our political and social future is just a slight variation of the past -- whether it's a slight upgrade in capitalism or an improved dictatorship. The rise in populism reflects a reaction to this lack of vision.

There is a longing for community and belongingness yet there is a huge fear of commitment (individually and collectively)

Why is it we can't talk about politics and religion in a civilised way?
