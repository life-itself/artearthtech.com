## The connection between cities, shared-living and sustainability.

<img src="/images/co_living_Sarah_Hickson.jpg"><br/><br/>

As the global population surges and urbanization increases, a growing mix of economic, social, and environmental pressures are building up in urban life.  Scarce property and unaffordable costs of living are making the “everyone an owner” model difficult to sustain. Unsustainable production, consumption, and waste trends are threatening to tip us beyond what the planet can handle.     And loneliness is fast becoming the next public health pandemic as communities and organic social interaction disintegrate.
It is within this context that a  a new type of living trend is emerging. Reinforced by increased mobility opportunities made possible by digital technology and cheap travel,  co-living is a modern form of housing where residents share living space and a set of interests, values, and/or intentions. It is an old idea re-imagined for our modern realities, emphasizing community and convenience.

We want to better understand this trend and identify the links between such spaces and sustainability, wellbeing, and new economic patterns. We are going out there, exploring communities, sharing information about the different models we encounter, and reporting on what works and what doesn’t work.

Communities are valuable. They inspire us. We want to help develop communities that have impact, with values and structures that align with our needs.
