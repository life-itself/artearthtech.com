The week will include meditation and discussions, workshops and storytelling â€” plus food from the gardens and a late night bonfire.

Mornings will be dedicated to discussion around wisdom in specific areas such as technology or the environment. The afternoons will be dedicated to workshops and expeditions such as communication through play, data wrangling and exploration of the local countryside.

We will preserve space in the program to allow for suggestions during the week and we welcome ideas for new topics and activities both in advance and during the event.
