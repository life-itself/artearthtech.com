The week will include meditation and discussions, workshops and storytelling â€” plus food from the gardens and a late night bonfire.

During the Gathering we will come together to share our vision of Art / Earth / Tech. It will also be a moment to support each other to fulfill our collective and individual dreams. We will have moments to explore specific areas such as Collective Intelligence,  Beyond mind perception play, Art / Earth / Tech issue tree the road map.

The Gathering is a moment for the mind, heart, soul and body to meet through a powerful shared experience.

We will preserve space in the program to allow for suggestions during the week and we welcome ideas for new topics and activities both in advance.
