What would a political system which allow our politician to make wise decision look like? What would the values and actions be? How would it work? Our citizens crave a leader, a leader who will drive them out of these crises, someone authentic who would stand for them. We long for heros but what we truly need is to transform ourselves, for each citizen to be fully responsible for themselves, so we may see the birth of a new state built around wisdom.
