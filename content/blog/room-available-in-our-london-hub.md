We need a better way to live, together.

A growing number of us are seeking lives that are meaningful as well as productive, yet we often struggle to find a balance. We need a wiser way of living whilst remaining engaged in conventional society. A way to live in cities whilst being in community, to be present as well as purposeful, that supports us to be the best version of ourselves.

We are building that way, starting with co-living communities across Europe.

We seek pioneers and believers in community to be **residents of our hub in London from December 2019**.

As one of the residents you will be part of a small, supportive community and get to shape its culture. You will get to live in a shared apartment off Hoxton Street in East London. As part of an international network, you will be connected to our other hubs in Berlin, the beautiful French countryside 40 min from Paris and soon Bergerac in southern France. You will be part of a collective that supports you to develop personally, and provides you with an opportunity to reflect on what really matters to you.
