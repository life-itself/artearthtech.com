### Untitled


There is a sleeping dog next to me

He jumped on me determined

To get his excitement

I held my fellow wearily

Determined to get my peace

Felt his muscles and ribs and pulse

And mine for maybe five minutes,

As though he were a silent little man

that I would never hold so deeply

lest we ask what it means

and gracefully plot our distances

lest one incline inconveniently

Towards that full and simple silence

Here we are.
