Our second Blind Spots event: Returning to mystery / Being unattached to certainty will take place on the 19th of May from 3.30pm-5h30pm at  St. Ethelburga’s Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, 78 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 4AG.

Artists, contemplatives, and scientists will explore similarities and differences between the many routes “out of our head” through art, mindfulness, nature, and therapy. We will also explore how our emotional attachment to knowledge and certainty keeps us in our heads and have an artistic ritual for the release of that attachment.

## Here are a list of presenters:

**Science:** Liam Kavanagh will discuss how science systematically fails to understand some aspects of experience, using perspectives from emotional cognitive science and non-western philosophy. Liam will draw on his experience in research and organising dialogues with scientists at Plum Village Buddhist Monastery.

**Performance Art:** Sylvie Barbier is a performance artist and co-founder of Art / Earth / Tech.  She will lead the ritual of releasing the dream of knowing everything.

**Public Policy:** Jamie Bristow runs the Mindfulness initiative which helps to introduce capacities of heart and mind part of public policy in the UK and around governments.

**Science:** Nafees Hamid is a researcher at University College London and a writer for New York reviews of Books. He studies how the West’s secular worldview affects our understanding of radicals and their sacred values.

**Design:** Poppy Rose and Mark McGlynn are architects and designers. Partners both in life and in aesthetic devotion to the Wabi-Sabi sensibility which they inject into buildings and interiors across the world. Wabi Sabi is a beauty of “asymmetry, roughness, and the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.

**Art:** Sam Winston is an artist whose practice is concerned with language not only as a carrier of messages but also as a visual form in and of itself. Initially known for his typography and artist’s books he employs a variety of different approaches including drawing, performance and poetry. He is also active in conflict resolution.

## Why the return to mystery:

Lately, one hears a lot about “being present”, and “getting out of our heads”, “embodiment”, “bodywork”, somatic therapy, yoga, meditation, and more. There are similarities in the way these things are being talked about, and it never seems possible to draw a clear line through them, or to say precisely how they are connected. The impossibility of being talked about precisely is part of what brings these things together.

We are suspicious of things that can’t be said precisely, but this is because we highly attached to certainty. We will thus end the gathering with an artistic ritual to release our dreams of knowing it all.
