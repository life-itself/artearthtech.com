Our second Blind Spots event: Returning to mystery: Saving Ourselves will take place on the 19th of May from 3.30pm-5h30pm at  St. Ethelburga’s Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, 78 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 4AG.

Artists, activists, therapists, and scientists will explore similarities and differences between the many routes “out of our head” through art, mindfulness, nature, and therapy and how these increase our awareness -- from personal trauma to climate change. We will also conclude with an artistic ritual for the release of certaintly and control, the impulse that keeps us out of the present.

## Why the return to mystery:

Lately, one hears a lot about “being present”, and “getting out of our heads”, “embodiment”, “bodywork”, somatic therapy, yoga, meditation, and more. There are similarities in the way these things are being talked about, and it never seems possible to draw a clear line through them, or to say precisely how they are connected. The impossibility of being talked about precisely is part of what brings these things together.

We are suspicious of things that can’t be said precisely, but this is because we highly attached to certainty. We will thus end the gathering with an artistic ritual to release our dreams of knowing it all.
