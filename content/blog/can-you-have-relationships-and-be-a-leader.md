title = "Can you have relationships and be a leader? "

+++
I had a phone call earlier with a woman regarding a leadership and development course. In that call, I heard myself share a whole story I didn’t realise I had about what it was to be ‘a leader’, and this despite many leadership training courses, and a MSc with Strategic Leadership in the title! And the story was: it is a solo venture, removing you from your community, family and friends and living a life in hotel rooms, alone.

Being Big meant being an individual. Being a leader was only in the workplace. It meant more responsibility, less joy and little capacity for relationships. After the call, I spoke to my friend who I co-work with, who had also done the progressive leadership MSc with me in Sweden. She too had the same story. It was being a-lone.

Earlier this week, I had a reflection on what it would take to be a community leader. I am a consultant on community building, development and enterprise planning working with national funders, yet I move home regularly and a place-based community is something I am standing for this year.

On the call, I heard the woman relay her own story of leadership. In it she was a stand for her family. She had wanted to be a leader in her family. She regaled names of infamous popular leaders we know of, and how central their family was to their life and success, and therefore leadership. Ones relationships are a core element of leadership, and thus your primary ones have to be strong and resilient. If anything, leadership is relationship - how you empower others depends on how you _are_ in relationship and the quality of them.

In light of this, I am imagining leadership whilst in relationship too, and my leadership being a stand for the flourishing of my community.
