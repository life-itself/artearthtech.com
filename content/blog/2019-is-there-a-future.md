On **Wednesday 31st July, 6-9pm at Ugly Duck Arts, 49 Tanner St, Bermondsey, London SE1 3PL** , we are holding a performance and installation art event entitled **'Is there a Future?'** As human beings we are compelled to think about the future constantly; imagining a happy future is a key ingredient for a joyful life. For some, having children is a central part of this. How do we decide whether to have children or not in the midst of an ecological crisis? Showcasing work by AET members Sylvie Barbier, Cecile Embleton, members of the BirthStrike movement Jess Johannesson Gaitán and Adam Ley-Lange, and the founders of Fourthland, the evening will invite collective reflection on reproduction, the ecological crisis and our future.

# Artists
Selected international artists have been invited to examine the two fold theme of parenthood and the ecological crisis and what arises from discovering just how intimately intertwined these themes are. The works will explore; the joy, love and hope that is born in our necessity to create new life - on both a personal and collective level - grieving for a sense of mothering that we have lost in our relationship to nature and in our societies, and the urgent ecological challenges we face in order to create a viable future for our children.


# Sylvie Shiwei Barbier
