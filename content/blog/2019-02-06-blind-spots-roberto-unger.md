What is holding us back from creating a powerful and inspiring vision for our future? Why do we seem stuck in making minor upgrades to managerial capitalism?

For our first event on Sunday 17th March, held with the Institute for Public Policy Research, we are excited to welcome [Professor Roberto Unger][unger] of Harvard Law School. One of the youngest law professors in Harvard's history at 29, he played a significant role in bringing democracy back to Brazil, served in Lula's government as a minister and has been called “a prophet” by the famed philosopher Richard Rorty. A key influence and inspiration to Obama he was also one of Obama's toughest critics, memorably arguing against Obama's second term.

Unger is the author of several important and groundbreaking works, most recently “The Future of American Progressivism” and “The Knowledge Economy". For decades, he has been a [pragmatic utopian][utopian], working to envision a practical path to a radically better future at a time when such political dreams were unfashionable. An outspoken critic of neoliberalism and a prophet before his time, he early identified the ideological bankruptcy of managerial capitalism. Now, at a time when history seems to be proving him right, we should learn all what  we can from this pioneering voice.
