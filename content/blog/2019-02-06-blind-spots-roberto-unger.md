Blind Spots is our new serie of conferences on what are the collective Blind spots of our society?
Why are we hold back from powerfully creating an inspiring vision for our world?
Why is it that our world seems to be in a vicious circle of capitalism 1.0 to 2.3 with just better management?
Why is it that the words "Utopia, commmnity, spritituality or Big vision" people react with skepticism and fear?

On Sunday 17th March we will have the privilege to have a special guest Dr Roberto Unger profesor at Havard Law school and
who's political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil.

The event will be an space for authentic share of differents view to what has lead us to Trump, the Brazilian election and Brexit?

At Art/ Earth / Tech we believe that it is important and crucial to engage in these big conversation to look at what is in our way as a society to come up with a New Big Vision and act powerfully on it.
