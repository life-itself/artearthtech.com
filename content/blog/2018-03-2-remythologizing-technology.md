When I was 4 my mother would take me to the Louvre as she was preparing for her exam to become a tour guide. She will always bring paper and pencil for me to sit and draw and my favorite section was the greek sculptures! Not only was these sculpture fabulous about these extraordinary gods and goddess but their mythology where so powerful! These stories and archetype became part of my own mythology.

We live in a world of Mythologies, they are the stories that reinforce the way we relate to ourselves and the world around us. Mythology can be liberating but also a prison, we’ve seen many battle to free ourselves from certain myths. eg: that women are less than man.

So what are the myth we live in today? Myth are so powerful, we don’t even realised we live in them because they are norms. I am in particular interested in the myths we have around technology and of human nature.

The current two myth that I see around Technology is the one of the savior like prometheus. Technology will save us! As these engineers and start up bring these innovations to save us from a future apocalypse! Because our human nature is weak, lustful and  sinful. We are stained by the original sin of Adam and Eve.

The other myth around technology is Frankenstein, we create monster and  our creation over power us, will AI destroy us? Because we are monster so our creation can only be monsters too.

Why is it that we relate to technology is this binary way? The way we relate to technology is only a reflection of how we relate to ourselve. Why do we need technology to save us ? Because the myth we have about ourselve is that we are weak, lustful and sinful. Why will our creation be monstrous? Because we believe we are monsters only capable to create something terrible. The original sin is following us like a shadow, never free.
Indeed if we do not trust who we are in our core, how can we trust the other? If we do not have faith in ourselves how can we have faith in our future? So it is not surprising that we perceive technology to be the solution.

See the myth we have about technology only show us the miss trust we have about our human nature and fellows. “Human nature is horrific, it will destroy mother earth, we’ve used the Atomic Bomb, we only know how to solve conflics with wars and genocides.”

 We survive in a paradigm where are not to be trusted and we therefore look at everything around us to prove us this very exact point.

We are so fearful of ourselves that it stops us to look into ourselve and be loving and caring to ourselves. As we are so terrible we are undeserving to be loved and cared for.  This myth creates a terrible disconnection from each other but most of all from our own individual consciousness. Yet it is only our consciousness which can help us to elevate ourselves beyond our animal instincts and impulses. We are so scared of our human nature that we try to find an escape through the myth that technology will save us. We endlessly create without deeply reflecting on what it is that we give to the world. We give into our emotions without reflecting what are the seeds we water in our heart. In a world of material abundance we still feel so scares! With all this freedom to have we forgot that true freedom is the one to BE.  We see that today to NOT have and to NOT create has become a political act reflecting our consciousness that we can take another path.

We focus on our intelligence to solve problem but are blind to the fact that what we need before collective intelligence is collective love. Because if need to apply our intelligence together in order to find answer to problems that are too big for single individuals to answer, we need collective love to heal to wounds that drove us to perpetuate more pain and horrors. Suffering of these amplitude of from wars can not be healed by a single person.

So if the myth we currently are bath in is the one of prometheus, frankenstein and the original sin. There is yet a myth that is taking deeper roots, one of deep compassion, self awareness and transformation. Indeed what if the greatest technology is not outside of us  but inside of us? What if this ultimate technology we’ve been looking for has been there all the time, waiting. What if the greatest Technology of all was our consciousness? We spend all this time running around looking for the next, new, hot, interesting thing and stop looking in ourselves. We can learn to be in touch with the power of the mind.
As Technology is evolving ever faster it is time to reclaim the mythology we have about human nature. Human consciousness like any other piece of technology advancement is only a reflection of how much attention we have given to it.

If human nature have all the vices of anger, lust, hate it also has all the qualities of kindness, compassion and love. Power is in what we give attention to. Maybe it time to give power to ourselves by dwelling into our consciousness and explore all our hidden capacities.

Maybe it is time to Re-mythologize human nature to one that is good, kind and loving by nature.
