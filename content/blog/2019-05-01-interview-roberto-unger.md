<b>About Roberto Unger:</b>
<p>Unger is the author of several important and groundbreaking works, most recently “The Future of American Progressivism” and “The Knowledge Economy". For decades, he has been a [pragmatic utopian][utopian], working to envision a practical path to a radically better future at a time when such political dreams were unfashionable. An outspoken critic of neoliberalism and a prophet before his time, he early identified the ideological bankruptcy of managerial capitalism. Now, at a time when history seems to be proving him right, we should learn all what  we can from this pioneering voice. </p>
