### Who you are

You are an optimist, you are a stand for people and helping them realise their potential. You see beyond the drama of day to day and hold people to their greatness. You do not get caught up in gossip or stories, and are able to see through all that to what's often behind it. You participate and follow philosophical discussions and can apply that to the everyday living. You can also switch from discussing Heidegger to checking if there is enough loo roll for an event. Having worked or lived in community before, you value your boundaries and know when they can spill over. You are giving and you are responsible. When it's lights out, its lights out.

You give your word to things and are open to when that word has to be broken. You are comfortable in confrontation and donâ’t avoid conflict. You are practicing non judgement on yourself and others. You are coherent in your communication and your way of being. You prioritise your way of being and are not attached to your thoughts and feelings. You really want to make a difference to people's lives. You believe whole heartedly in community being where that difference can happen: collective action is the way! You like to play, like other human beings, like to see connections and bridge networks, like to host and celebrate, and are a stand for a wiser culture.
