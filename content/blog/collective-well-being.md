The [Art / Earth / Tech Institute](https://artearthtech.com/institute/) wrote this paper last year on Collective Wellbeing, the second in our series following [Collective Intelligence](). Our latest Collective Wisdom paper is out soon. 

> A true conviction that human well-being is the most important goal would imply revolutionary changes in our lives and our societies. That such deep changes are necessary is also somewhat odd, given that well-being is one of the most basic, longest enduring, and universal goals of mankind. Here we explore what has kept a well-being focus from shaping our private lives, the organisations that we spend our time being part of, or our society at large, and propose ways to reorient ourselves.
