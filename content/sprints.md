Sprints are an opportunity to take time away from your everyday engagements to reflect and focus on a project of your choice surrounded by an amazing community in an incredible environment.

The sprints take place at [La Cheraille][], a secluded farming hamlet just outside Paris that is the perfect space for reflection, concentration and collaboration.
