* 8am - 9am: Breakfast
* 9am - 10am: Wisdom discussion and activites
* 11am - 11:30am: Break
* 11:30am - 12:30pm: Open space for people to organize sessions
* 12:30 - 2pm: Lunch
* 2pm - 4pm: Afternoon practical workshops
* 4pm - 6pm: Workshops, yoga, perception play and open space
* 6pm - 7pm: Reflection and open space
* 7pm - 8:30pm: Supper

We also plan special events for the evenings after including storytelling and a celebratory bonfire.
