We are practical and natural. We connect the ancient and the modern. Our interests ranges from nature to neuroscience, Dada to data. We seek harmony and to disrupt, bringing together art and technology, earth and spirit, science and wisdom, freedom and discipline, mindfulness and intention. Our name reflects this commitment to a holistic approach.

The hub is a home in Taipei for people looking to find a middle-way between the hamster wheel and [Mani wheel][wheel], the condo and the campervan. Through dinners, art, poetry nights, talks and sprint weekends we come together to be and to do, but mostly be. The doing always takes care of itself when the being is good.
