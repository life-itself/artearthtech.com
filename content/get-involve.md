We want to bring together all kinds of people who have at their heart a deep concern to help improve the world and a desire to do so wisely.

Farmers and technologists, researchers lawyers and artists, young and old â€” all are welcome.

We believe this conversation needs to be open and broad so that we may enhance each other understanding by sharing our knowledge and skills.
