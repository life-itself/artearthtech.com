We have a strictly **limited capacity of twenty** -- in keeping with the high-quality and exclusive nature of the program.

We will select participants based on their interests, experience and commitment.

The course will be conducted in English so we recommend a reasonable level of spoken English. **No technical expertise or domain knowledge is needed**. The course will suit both experts and novices in the area of information technology. We strongly encourage participants with keen interest but little experience to apply.
