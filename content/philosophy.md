Art, Earth, Tech is not just an educational program, it is a philosophy. <strong>Ultimately we seek to foster wisdom, wholeness, and well-being</strong> of individuals and societies. We do this by sharing skills and understanding.

We have always depended on nature and technology as well as our capacity to reflect and learn in order to live vibrantly and sustainably. Today in a world that is changing ever fast- er, it is crucial to adapt and develop our capacities in these areas so we may continue to thrive into the future.

<strong>We emphasize the joy of learning and of learning and sharing together.</strong> We expect participants to engage in the daily life of La Cheraille, including helping with the kitchen, eating together, and maintaining the beauty and harmony of the place.
