# AET Institute

Wisdom is perhaps the most valuable thing we have, but the hardest to define.

The AET Institute exists to identify the principles that can guide us to a wiser, weller world, and apply these to living projects.

Breadth of thought should be combined with localized, focused action. This means we believe in having both application and reflection under one roof and that learning is a cycle of reflection and experience:

~~We often spend time discussing the merits of reflection and application, but this is something like comparing the value of a chicken and its egg.~~

## Some Specific Areas of Interest

* The Promotion of Well-Living
  * What is a workable conception of ''the Good Life?'', one that a diversity of people can agree on?
  * How can we make it easier for each other to live this kind of life?
  * Challenging growth-centrism, from lifestyle choices to policies.

* Wise Technology
  * [Open Knowledge Issues]()
    Open Information Fund
  * [Distracting and Addicting Technology]()

* Mindfulness Beyond Stress Reduction.

  _In recent years millions of westerners have discovered that ancient practice of mindfulness is great way of managing stress. We are interested in non-dogmatic exploration of the traditional Buddhist claim that mindfulness practice only reaches its fullest potential for human benefit when paired with complementary perspectives on psychology and human affairs. Especially, this approach to living has implications for challenging western notions about the place of rationality in life, and the pursuit of purpose._

* [(Im)measurability, Value and Policy]()
  * Can all that matters be measured?
  * How to demonstrate the value of intangible and subjective approaches.
  * How to turn our priorities into policy, given the difficulty of measurement.

* [Social Intelligence]() -- We've created a complex society, in which, it seems, no individual can fully understand what is going on around him. How do we put our heads together more effectively to understand the world we live in and solve problems like global warming?
* [Renewing the Foundations for Art and Aesthetics]() (Make a Piece from Creative Bulimia)

### Why Here and Now?

Contemporary western society enjoys levels of material abundance unknown in the history of man. However, our sense of well-being is not increasing over time and surveys continue to believe that citizens of western societies [mostly believe they are on the wrong track, whereas countries that are much poorer believe they are on the right track. ](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/which-countries-are-on-the-right-track-according-to-their-citizens/)

Perhaps there is no mystery, here, the West has pursued a way of life that is focused on economic growth. The rest of the world, impressed by our growth, has followed suit. The simple reason for the divergence between the two sets of countries is the that the average citizen of the west is far past the point when more possessions translate into greater happiness, whereas increased growth is really making lives better in the countries that are poor.

If wisdom is the thing that allows us to make open-ended decisions that lead to a better life, it must be what we need more of. We continually emphasize being smarter and harder working to succeed, but we do not ask ourselves -- succeed at what?

Our values are not reflected in our day to day life as individuals, communities, and societies. How to make different choices as people and societies is a question that we will continue to face.




A movement to weller ways of life.

The Art Earth Tech Research Institute exists to identify and apply the principles than can underlie a wiser, weller ways of life. At various levels of society our existing ideas, values, and culture reinforce one another.



To mention one primary concern, Western civilization remains concerned about further material progress when our average citizen is far past the point when more possessions translate into greater happiness.


Mental illness is increasing, while measures of life satisfaction are stagnant.

## Guiding Notions:

### Application and Reflection Under One Roof.

The processes of Application and Reflection are often discussed as opposites, when actually they are indivisable.

! [Image -- steal it]()

Certainly, the application of ideas is the ultimate test of their worth. One must have ideas in order to apply them, but the world in which they must be applied is much more complex than humans minds can handle. We cannot understand it completely, cannot prove that any particular way of ?improving society? is best.  The complexity of the world also means that any time we try to engage with it, we will be overwhelmed by the amount of detail unless we bring some kind structure to it. This is the job of the intellect.


This may invite the question: What is wisdom? Wisdom may seem difficult to define, but this does not mean that it is an insubstantial notion.  Words such as "intelligence" or "smartness" are no less difficult to define, but we don't question whether they mean anything.

Wisdom is not the same as being smart -- it takes into account both the ends pursued and the means used pursue them. You can be a clever hedonist, but it is not clear you can be a wise one.

If hearing a call for wisdom excites some resistance in us, this may be less due to the fact that calling something unwise is controversial.  We talk about smartness constantly but wisdom is seldom mentioned.

We believe that means are never able to be divorced from ends, because the ultimate end is a state of mind, a way of being, and ways of being are habitual. A way of being cultivated while using unwholesome means cannot ultimately serve the end of being unafraid, open and free.
