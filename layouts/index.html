          Breadth of thought should be combined with localized, focused action. This means we believe in having both application and reflection under one roof and that learning is a cycle of reflection and experience.

          Sprints are an opportunity to take time away from your everyday engagements to reflect and focus on a project of your choice surrounded by an amazing community in an incredible environment. The sprints take place at La Cheraille, a secluded farming hamlet just outside Paris that is the perfect space for reflection, concentration and collaboration.

          Once a year at the end of July we come together for a week as a community, to network, share knowledge and continue to reflect on what is wisdom in the 21st century. We spend time together, relax and consider ways we can be intentional and well in our life both as individual and as a society.
